# wxLua - Lua wrapper around the wxWidgets cross-platform C++ GUI library
 - modified to support Lua 5.3 (including integers)
 - changed method search ( GetClassMethod ) to find nearest overload in incapsulation
 - broken some compatibility with Lua 5.2 and older
 - added some missing function bindings, few missing classes
 - fixed some wx config.h issues when some features disabled
 - I forgot what I also did with it :/
